## Description

This project is an API built using [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) and [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

It uses TypeORM to connect to a MariaDB database

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# start database
$ make start

# development
$ yarn run start

# stop database
$ make stop
```

## Decisions log

- A database is required to run the API, Docker is used to spin a local instance of MariaDB.
- The code has been organized using a Domain Driven Design approach.
- To define the schema of the GraphQL server, a `Schema first` approach is used because I like to have the schema to be 
explicitly defined, plus in my opinion, it makes it less verbose when there are response objects that don't follow the 
definition of your domain objects.
- The protected endpoints from the `Nft` module can only be accessed when a valid JWT is used. When that is the case,
the user can only list and transfer its own assets.
- There is no unit tests because there is no real domain logic implemented on the application or domain layer. 
Integration tests would be interesting on this solution, but these were not the purpose of this example.

## Possible improvements

With more time, these are some changes I would do on the project:
- Would try to configure the GraphQL so the autogenerated classes and interfaces would be inside each module's folder.
Makes it easier to import generated types, and it keeps everything more closely coupled.
- Would add validation in the data that comes from the GraphQL payload.
- Would add integration tests to verify the behavior on the repositories and application services.
